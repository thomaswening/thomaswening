# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Thomas Wening!  
I‚Äôm a **Software Developer** with a background in **physics (M.Sc.)**, specializing in **C#/.NET**.  

Professionally, I develop software for **data management and automation in life sciences**, particularly in **high-content screening (HCS) and image-based analysis**. My work currently focuses on:  
- **Building and optimizing WPF and WinForms applications** for laboratory environments.
- **Handling large-scale experimental data**, integrating with databases, file storage and analytical tools.  
- **Enhancing image processing and analysis workflows** to support research and diagnostics.  
- **Designing robust, scalable architectures** for scientific software solutions.  

‚û°Ô∏è **For professional repositories, visit my work-related GitHub profile:** 
- [**thomaswening-work**](https://github.com/thomaswening-work) *(Currently no public repositories)*  

Outside of work, I explore new concepts and refine my skills by working on small projects. Sometimes legacy code at work limits how things *should* be done, so I rebuild concepts from scratch to deepen my understanding. 

And other times, I just like to experiment and play around‚Ä¶

*(Yes, that‚Äôs a [Sierpinski carpet](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Sierpinski_carpet).)*  

### üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects  
- **[PhaseShift](https://github.com/thomaswening/PhaseShift/tree/main)** ‚Äì a stylish productivity timer app for developers, with Pomodoro, stopwatch, and custom timer modes.
- **[Salter](https://github.com/thomaswening/salter)** ‚Äì a console app exploring core security and user management concepts in .NET.  
- **[ContactKeeper](https://github.com/thomaswening/ContactKeeper)** ‚Äì a WPF-based contact management app using MaterialDesign.

### üîß Work in Progress *(not yet public or on hold)*  
- **[Notepad Clone](https://github.com/thomaswening/NotePadClone)** ‚Äì a lightweight, dark-mode-friendly text editor for Windows 10 *(on hold)*.  
- **Background Job Dispatcher** ‚Äì Inspired by a topic from my workplace, I‚Äôm implementing this from scratch to learn about logging, data integrity, efficient high-volume data transfer, reporting, and interprocess communication. *(I plan to develop a simple client to define jobs to run.)*  
- **Monte Carlo Integration Module** ‚Äì A Python module comprising Monte Carlo integrators with different sampling algorithms, along with mathematical benchmarks against exact values.
