# 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Wening!  
I’m a **Software Developer** with a background in **physics (M.Sc.)**, specializing in **C#, .NET, and Python**.  

## 💻 What I Do Professionally  
I develop software for **data management and automation in life sciences**, particularly in **high-content screening (HCS) and image-based analysis**. My work focuses on:  
- **Building and optimizing WPF applications** used in laboratory environments.  
- **Handling large-scale experimental data** efficiently, integrating with databases and analytical tools.  
- **Enhancing image processing and analysis workflows** to support research and diagnostics.  
- **Implementing robust, scalable architectures** for scientific software solutions.

## 🚀 What I Work on Privately  
Outside of work, I explore **performance optimization, scientific computing, and software security**, with projects in:  
- **Parallelized file validation** – designing checksum verification tools for large datasets.  
- **Custom job scheduling systems** – handling task automation, execution timing, and parallel job processing.  
- **Scientific computing & physics simulations** – implementing Monte Carlo methods, numerical integration, and QFT-related calculations.  
- **Encryption and secure data storage** – experimenting with cryptographic principles in .NET.  
- **Fractal generation & algorithmic art** – developing scalable rendering techniques for mathematical structures.  

## 📚 Currently Learning  
- **Advanced .NET and WPF** – fine-tuning async programming, multithreading, and UI performance.  
- **High-performance computing** – optimizing numerical methods for large-scale simulations.  
- **Software architecture & maintainability** – designing systems that scale efficiently.  

## 📂 Check Out My Public Repositories  
I share projects that combine **algorithmic problem-solving, performance engineering, and scientific computing**. Take a look at my repositories to see what I’ve been working on!
