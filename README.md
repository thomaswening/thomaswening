ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas Wening
Iâ€™m a Software Developer with a background in physics (M.Sc.), specializing in C#, .NET, and Python.

ðŸ’» Professionally, I develop software using C#, WPF, SQL, and .NET, focusing on building features, solving technical challenges, and improving code quality.
ðŸš€ Privately, I use this GitHub profile to practice, experiment, and learn in my spare timeâ€”whether itâ€™s refining my C# and Python skills, diving deeper into WPF and async programming, or exploring new technologies.
ðŸ“š Currently learning: Advanced .NET development, WPF, multithreading, and performance optimization.
ðŸ“‚ Check out my public repositories to see what Iâ€™ve been working on!
