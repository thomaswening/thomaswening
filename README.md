# 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Wening!  
I’m a **Software Developer** with a background in **physics (M.Sc.)**, specializing in **C#/.NET**.  

## 💻 Professional Work  
I develop software for **data management and automation in life sciences**, particularly in **high-content screening (HCS) and image-based analysis**. My work focuses on:  
- **Building and optimizing WPF applications** for laboratory environments.  
- **Handling large-scale experimental data**, integrating with databases and analytical tools.  
- **Enhancing image processing and analysis workflows** to support research and diagnostics.  
- **Designing robust, scalable architectures** for scientific software solutions.

## 🚀 Personal Projects  
Outside of work, I explore new concepts and refine my skills by working on small projects. Sometimes legacy code at work limits how things *should* be done, so I rebuild concepts from scratch to deepen my understanding. 

And other times, I just like to experiment and play around…

*(Yes, that’s a [Sierpinski carpet](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Sierpinski_carpet).)*  

### 🛠️ Current Projects  
- **[ContactKeeper](https://github.com/thomaswening/ContactKeeper)** – a WPF-based contact management app using MaterialDesign.
- **[Salter](https://github.com/thomaswening/salter)** – a console app exploring core security and user management concepts in .NET.  
- **[PhaseShift](https://github.com/thomaswening/PhaseShift/tree/main)** – a stylish productivity timer app for developers, with Pomodoro, stopwatch, and custom timer modes.

### 🔧 Work in Progress *(not yet public or on hold)*  
- **[Notepad Clone](https://github.com/thomaswening/NotePadClone)** – a lightweight, dark-mode-friendly text editor for Windows 10 *(on hold)*.  
- **Background Job Dispatcher** – Inspired by a topic from my workplace, I’m implementing this from scratch to learn about logging, data integrity, efficient high-volume data transfer, reporting, and interprocess communication. *(I plan to develop a simple client to define jobs to run.)*  
- **Monte Carlo Integration Module** – A Python module comprising Monte Carlo integrators with different sampling algorithms, along with mathematical benchmarks against exact values.  

## 📚 Currently Learning  
- **.NET & WPF architecture** – refining MVVM, async programming, and scalable UI patterns.  
- **GitHub Actions** – automating workflows and CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Software architecture & maintainability** – designing scalable, maintainable systems.  
- **Scientific computing** – Monte Carlo integration, sampling algorithms, and Runge-Kutta methods.

### 📖 What I Want to Learn
- **Scientific computing with C++** – exploring numerical methods and high-performance computing.  
- **Web app and API development with ASP.NET** – designing scalable backends and modern web applications.  
- **Native Windows desktop applications with WinUI 3** – building modern, fluid UIs for Windows.  
- **Front-end development with JavaScript/TypeScript** – improving UI/UX skills and working with modern frameworks.
